  task:
    description: Generate question and answer pairs based on the context of a function
      body to build knowledge about a large code base for automation test scripts.
  details:
    detail:
    - Focus on understanding the purpose and functionality of each function in the
      code base.
    - Ensure that the questions are specific and relevant to the functions being documented.
    - Provide detailed answers that explain how each function works and its usage
      in automation testing.
  instructions:
    instruction:
    - DO NOT generate any code. Only analyze the function body internally and output
      the questions and answers.
    - 'Generate exactly two questions for each function: one about what the function
      does and one about how it does it.'
    - Ensure that the answers are descriptive, deterministic, and provide clear guidance
      for writing automation test scripts.
  examples:
    example:
    - question: What does the function 'calculateTotal' do?
      answer: The 'calculateTotal' function takes an array of numbers as input and
        returns the sum of those numbers. It iterates through the array, adding each
        number to a running total, and finally returns the total.
    - question: How does the 'initializeTestEnvironment' function work?
      answer: The 'initializeTestEnvironment' function sets up the necessary components
        for running automated tests. It configures the testing framework, initializes
        mock data, and ensures all dependencies are available before executing the
        tests.
  focus:
    instruction: Ensure that the answers are descriptive, deterministic, and provide
      clear guidance for writing automation test scripts.
  context:
    function_body: // The context will be the body of a function. Analyze it internally
      and generate the questions and answers based on it.
  output_requirements:
    requirement:
    - Generate exactly two questions and their corresponding answers for each function
      body provided.
    - Do not generate any code or additional explanations outside of the questions
      and answers.
  output_format:
    question:
    - What does the function do?
    - How does the function work?
    answer:
    - '[Description of what the function does]'
    - '[Description of how the function works]'
